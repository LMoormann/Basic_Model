Input files:
[1_Plant_Requirements.cif]                  Code for automata plant model, and state-based requirements
[2_Simulation.cif]                          Code for hybrid plant model, imports [3_Visualization.cif] 
[3_Visualization.cif]                       Code for link between hybrid plant model and SVG visualization 
[4_Basic_Model.svg]                         SVG visualization of the basic model

Output files:
[generated_files/5_Supervisor.cif]          Set of synthesized supervisors using [Multilevel.tooldef2]
[generated_files/6_Supervisor_Hybrid.cif]   Merge of [2_Simulation.cif] and [5_Supervisor.cif], using [Simulation.tooldef2]

Executable files:
[Multilevel.tooldef2]                       Execute to synthesize [5_Supervisor.cif] from [1_Plant_Requirements.cif]
[Simulation.tooldef2]                       Execute to generate and simulate [6_Supervisor_Hybrid.cif]
